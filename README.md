# üß† Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using RNN, GRU & LSTM

This repository provides a complete end-to-end deep learning pipeline for **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** using **Bidirectional RNN**, **GRU**, and **LSTM** models to classify tweets into **positive**, **neutral**, and **negative** sentiments.

---

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Inside?

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Tweets are cleaned, tokenized, and padded for input into deep learning models.

2. **Label Encoding**
   - Sentiment labels are converted into one-hot encoded vectors for multi-class classification.

3. **Model Architectures**
   - ‚úÖ **Bidirectional RNN**  
     Captures both forward and backward context. Regularization included to reduce overfitting.  
     _Accuracy: ~89.1%_

   - ‚úÖ **Bidirectional GRU**  
     Lighter and faster alternative to LSTM, captures sequential dependencies efficiently.  
     _Accuracy: ~90.2%_

   - ‚úÖ **Bidirectional LSTM**  
     Excels in modeling long-term dependencies and improves performance significantly.  
     _Accuracy: ~92.0%_

4. **Training Setup**
   - Dropout, L2 regularization, and EarlyStopping to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report for comprehensive model assessment.

6. **Visualization**
   - Training/validation loss and accuracy plots  
   - Confusion matrix heatmaps

## üìà Why This Project Matters

Sentiment analysis is key to:
- Social media monitoring
- Customer service automation
- Product feedback analysis
- Brand reputation management

This project shows that even without transformers, **RNN-based models still rock** when tuned right. GRUs and LSTMs offer increasing accuracy with deeper memory modeling.
