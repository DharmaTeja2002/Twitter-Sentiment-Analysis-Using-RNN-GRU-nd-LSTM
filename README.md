# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-RNN-and-LSTM
This repo contains a complete end-to-end pipeline for Twitter Sentiment Analysis leveraging deep learning models ‚Äî specifically Bidirectional RNN and LSTM architectures ‚Äî to classify tweets into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

üöÄ What‚Äôs Inside?
Data Preprocessing: Clean, tokenize, and pad tweets for efficient input into neural networks.

Label Encoding: Converting categorical sentiments into machine-readable formats with one-hot encoding.

Model Architectures:

Bidirectional Simple RNN: Captures context from both past and future tokens with regularization techniques to minimize overfitting.

LSTM Model: Enhanced sequence learning using LSTM layers to improve long-term dependencies and accuracy.

Training Setup: Early stopping callbacks to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.

Evaluation: Detailed accuracy and loss tracking on both validation and test sets, achieving strong performance:

RNN: ~89% accuracy

LSTM: ~92% accuracy ‚Äî clear proof that memory helps!

Performance Visualization: Includes confusion matrices and classification reports for deep insights into model strengths and weaknesses.

üìà Why This Matters?
Sentiment analysis is a cornerstone of modern NLP applications ‚Äî from brand monitoring to social media analytics and customer feedback analysis. This project demonstrates how classic recurrent networks can still pack a punch when tuned right, while LSTMs elevate the performance by understanding sequence context better.
